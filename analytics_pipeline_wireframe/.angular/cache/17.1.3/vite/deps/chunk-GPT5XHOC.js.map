bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * @param name An identifying string.\n * @param definitions  An animation definition object, containing an array of\n * [`state()`](api/animations/state) and `transition()` declarations.\n *\n * @return An object that encapsulates the trigger data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * Define an animation trigger in the `animations` section of `@Component` metadata.\n * In the template, reference the trigger by name and bind it to a trigger expression that\n * evaluates to a defined animation state, using the following format:\n *\n * `[@triggerName]=\"expression\"`\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings convert all values to strings, and then match the\n * previous and current values against any linked transitions.\n * Booleans can be specified as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false`.\n *\n * ### Usage Example\n *\n * The following example creates an animation trigger reference based on the provided\n * name value.\n * The provided animation value is expected to be an array consisting of state and\n * transition declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: \"my-component\",\n *   templateUrl: \"my-component-tpl.html\",\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger\n * by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using an inline function\n * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide\n * if its associated animation should be run.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.\n * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:\n string]: any}): boolean {\n *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here\n *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';\n * }\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [\n *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [\n *         // the animation sequence code\n *       ]),\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"yes-please-animate\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations\n * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents\n * all animations from rendering.\n * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable\n * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers\n * within the element.\n *\n * The following example shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,\n * along with any inner animations.\n *\n * ### Disable animations application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,\n * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.\n * This means that you can disable all animations for an app\n * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`\n * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate\n * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n *\n * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nfunction trigger(name, definitions) {\n  return {\n    type: AnimationMetadataType.Trigger,\n    name,\n    definitions,\n    options: {}\n  };\n}\n/**\n * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.\n *\n * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.\n * A string in the format \"duration [delay] [easing]\".\n *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,\n * such as \"1s\" or \"10ms\" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.\n * The default unit is milliseconds.\n *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates\n * during its runtime.

`fromState => toState`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur then the\n *    expression bound to the trigger's element goes from `fromState` to `toState`\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition('open => closed', animate('.5s ease-out', style({ height: 0 }) ))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `fromState <=> toState`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur then\n *    the expression bound to the trigger's element goes from `fromState` to `toState` or vice versa\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition('enabled <=> disabled', animate('1s cubic-bezier(0.8,0.3,0,1)'))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `:enter`/`:leave`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur when the\n *    element enters or exists the DOM\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition(':enter', [\n *          style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *          animate('500ms', style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *        ])\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `:increment`/`:decrement`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur when\n *    the numerical expression bound to the trigger's element has increased in value or decreased\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition(':increment', query('@counter', animateChild()))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - a sequence of any of the above divided by commas, which indicates that transition's animations\n *    should occur whenever one of the state change expressions matches\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition(':increment, * => enabled, :enter', animate('1s ease', keyframes([\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1)', offset: 0}),\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1.1)', offset: 0.7}),\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1)', offset: 1})\n *        ]))),\n *      ```\n *\n * Also note that in such context:\n *  - `void` can be used to indicate the absence of the element\n *  - asterisks can be used as wildcards that match any state\n *  - (as a consequence of the above, `void => *` is equivalent to `:enter` and `* => void` is\n *    equivalent to `:leave`)\n *  - `true` and `false` also match expression values of `1` and `0` respectively (but do not match\n *    _truthy_ and _falsy_ values)\n *\n * <div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n *\n *  Be careful about entering end leaving elements as their transitions present a common\n *  pitfall for developers.\n *\n *  Note that when an element with a trigger enters the DOM its `:enter` transition always\n *  gets executed, but its `:leave` transition will not be executed if the element is removed\n *  alongside its parent (as it will be removed \"without warning\" before its transition has\n *  a chance to be executed, the only way that such transition can occur is if the element\n *  is exiting the DOM on its own).\n *\n *\n * </div>\n *\n * ### Animating to a Final State\n *\n * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value\n * with no `style` data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,\n * for the element to reach the final state, in such case Angular automatically adds or removes\n * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.\n *\n *\n * ### Usage Examples\n *\n *  - Transition animations applied based on\n *    the trigger's expression value\n *\n *   ```HTML\n *   <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">\n *    ...\n *   </div>\n *   ```\n *\n *   ```typescript\n *   trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *     ..., // states\n *     transition(\"on => off, open => closed\", animate(500)),\n *     transition(\"* <=> error\", query('.indicator', animateChild()))\n *   ])\n *   ```\n *\n *  - Transition animations applied based on custom logic dependent\n *    on the trigger's expression value and provided parameters\n *\n *    ```HTML\n *    <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"{\n *     value: stepName,\n *     params: { target: currentTarget }\n *    }\">\n *     ...\n *    </div>\n *    ```\n *\n *    ```typescript\n *    trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *      ..., // states\n *      transition(\n *        (fromState, toState, _element, params) =>\n *          ['firststep', 'laststep'].includes(fromState.toLowerCase())\n *          && toState === params?.['target'],\n *        animate('1s')\n *      )\n *    ])\n *    ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n **/\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options = null) {\n  return {\n    type: AnimationMetadataType.Transition,\n    expr: stateChangeExpr,\n    animation: steps,\n    options\n  };\n}\n/**\n * Produces a reusable animation that can be invoked in another animation or sequence,\n * by calling the `useAnimation()` function.\n *\n * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()`\n * or `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the\n * animation, and additional developer-defined parameters.\n * Provided values for additional parameters are used as defaults,\n * and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.\n * @returns An object that encapsulates the animation data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * The following example defines a reusable animation, providing some default parameter\n * values.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * var fadeAnimation = animation([\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ start }}' }),\n *   animate('{{ time }}',\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ end }}'}))\n *   ],\n *   { params: { time: '1000ms', start: 0, end: 1 }});\n * ```\n *\n * The following invokes the defined animation with a call to `useAnimation()`,\n * passing in override parameter values.\n *\n * ```js\n * useAnimation(fadeAnimation, {\n *   params: {\n *     time: '2s',\n *     start: 1,\n *     end: 0\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * If any of the passed-in parameter values are missing from this call,\n * the default values are used.

Use the 'limit' field to limit the total number of\n * items to collect.\n * @return An object that encapsulates the query data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Multiple Tokens\n *\n * Tokens can be merged into a combined query selector string. For example:\n *\n * ```typescript\n *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, @subTrigger', [...])\n * ```\n *\n * The `query()` function collects multiple elements and works internally by using\n * `element.querySelectorAll`. Use the `limit` field of an options object to limit\n * the total number of items to be collected. For example:\n *\n * ```js\n * query('div', [\n *   animate(...),\n *   animate(...)\n * ], { limit: 1 })\n * ```\n *\n * By default, throws an error when zero items are found. Set the\n * `optional` flag to ignore this error. For example:\n *\n * ```js\n * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [\n *   animate(...),\n *   animate(...)\n * ], { optional: true })\n * ```\n *\n * ### Entering and Leaving Elements\n *\n * Not all elements can be queried via the `:enter` and `:leave` tokens, the only ones\n * that can are those that Angular assumes can enter/leave based on their own logic\n * (if their insertion/removal is simply a consequence of that of their parent they\n * should be queried via a different token in their parent's `:enter`/`:leave` transitions).\n *\n * The only elements Angular assumes can enter/leave based on their own logic (thus the only\n * ones that can be queried via the `:enter` and `:leave` tokens) are:\n *  - Those inserted dynamically (via `ViewContainerRef`)\n *  - Those that have a structural directive (which, under the hood, are a subset of the above ones)\n *\n * <div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n *\n *  Note that elements will be successfully queried via `:enter`/`:leave` even if their\n *  insertion/removal is not done manually via `ViewContainerRef`or caused by their structural\n *  directive (e.g. they enter/exit alongside their parent).\n *\n * </div>\n *\n * <div class=\"alert is-important\">\n *\n *  There is an exception to what previously mentioned, besides elements entering/leaving based on\n *  their own logic, elements with an animation trigger can always be queried via `:leave` when\n * their parent is also leaving.\n *\n * </div>\n *\n * ### Usage Example\n *\n * The following example queries for inner elements and animates them\n * individually using `animate()`.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'inner',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [@queryAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       <h1>Title</h1>\n *       <div class=\"content\">\n *         Blah blah blah\n *       </div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *    trigger('queryAnimation', [\n *      transition('* => goAnimate', [\n *        // hide the inner elements\n *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),\n *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),\n *\n *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one\n *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 }))),\n *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 }))),\n *      ])\n *    ])\n *  ]\n * })\n * class Cmp {\n *   exp = '';\n *\n *   goAnimate() {\n *     this.exp = 'goAnimate';\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nfunction query(selector, animation, options = null) {\n  return {\n    type: AnimationMetadataType.Query,\n    selector,\n    animation,\n    options\n  };\n}\n/**\n * Use within an animation `query()` call to issue a timing gap after\n * each queried item is animated.\n *\n * @param timings A delay value.\n * @param animation One ore more animation steps.\n * @returns An object that encapsulates the stagger data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * In the following example, a container element wraps a list of items stamped out\n * by an `ngFor`.

The\n * following corner-cases will be validated:\n *\n * 1. Overlap of animations\n * Given that a CSS property cannot be animated in more than one place at the same time, it's\n * important that this behavior is detected and validated. The way in which this occurs is that\n * each time a style property is examined, a string-map containing the property will be updated with\n * the start and end times for when the property is used within an animation step.\n *\n * If there are two or more parallel animations that are currently running (these are invoked by the\n * group()) on the same element then the validator will throw an error. Since the start/end timing\n * values are collected for each property then if the current animation step is animating the same\n * property and its timing values fall anywhere into the window of time that the property is\n * currently being animated within then this is what causes an error.\n *\n * 2. Timing values\n * The validator will validate to see if a timing value of `duration delay easing` or\n * `durationNumber` is valid or not.\n *\n * (note that upon validation the code below will replace the timing data with an object containing\n * {duration,delay,easing}.\n *\n * 3. Offset Validation\n * Each of the style() calls are allowed to have an offset value when placed inside of keyframes().\n * Offsets within keyframes() are considered valid when:\n *\n *   - No offsets are used at all\n *   - Each style() entry contains an offset value\n *   - Each offset is between 0 and 1\n *   - Each offset is greater to or equal than the previous one\n *\n * Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n */\nfunction buildAnimationAst(driver, metadata, errors, warnings) {\n  return new AnimationAstBuilderVisitor(driver).build(metadata, errors, warnings);\n}\nconst ROOT_SELECTOR = '';\nclass AnimationAstBuilderVisitor {\n  constructor(_driver) {\n    this._driver = _driver;\n  }\n  build(metadata, errors, warnings) {\n    const context = new AnimationAstBuilderContext(errors);\n    this._resetContextStyleTimingState(context);\n    const ast = visitDslNode(this, normalizeAnimationEntry(metadata), context);\n    if (typeof ngDevMode === 'undefined' || ngDevMode) {\n      if (context.unsupportedCSSPropertiesFound.size) {\n        pushUnrecognizedPropertiesWarning(warnings, [...context.unsupportedCSSPropertiesFound.keys()]);\n      }\n    }\n    return ast;\n  }\n  _resetContextStyleTimingState(context) {\n    context.currentQuerySelector = ROOT_SELECTOR;\n    context.collectedStyles = new Map();\n    context.collectedStyles.set(ROOT_SELECTOR, new Map());\n    context.currentTime = 0;\n  }\n  visitTrigger(metadata, context) {\n    let queryCount = context.queryCount = 0;\n    let depCount = context.depCount = 0;\n    const states = [];\n    const transitions = [];\n    if (metadata.name.charAt(0) == '@') {\n      context.errors.push(invalidTrigger());\n    }\n    metadata.definitions.forEach(def => {\n      this._resetContextStyleTimingState(context);\n      if (def.type == AnimationMetadataType.State) {\n        const stateDef = def;\n        const name = stateDef.name;\n        name.toString().split(/\\s*,\\s*/).forEach(n => {\n          stateDef.name = n;\n          states.push(this.visitState(stateDef, context));\n        });\n        stateDef.name = name;\n      } else if (def.type == AnimationMetadataType.Transition) {\n        const transition = this.visitTransition(def, context);\n        queryCount += transition.queryCount;\n        depCount += transition.depCount;\n        transitions.push(transition);\n      } else {\n        context.errors.push(invalidDefinition());\n      }\n    });\n    return {\n      type: AnimationMetadataType.Trigger,\n      name: metadata.name,\n      states,\n      transitions,\n      queryCount,\n      depCount,\n      options: null\n    };\n  }\n  visitState(metadata, context) {\n    const styleAst = this.visitStyle(metadata.styles, context);\n    const astParams = metadata.options && metadata.options.params || null;\n    if (styleAst.containsDynamicStyles) {\n      const missingSubs = new Set();\n      const params = astParams || {};\n      styleAst.styles.forEach(style => {\n        if (style instanceof Map) {\n          style.forEach(value => {\n            extractStyleParams(value).forEach(sub => {\n              if (!params.hasOwnProperty(sub)) {\n                missingSubs.add(sub);\n              }\n            });\n          });\n        }\n      });\n      if (missingSubs.size) {\n        context.errors.push(invalidState(metadata.name, [...missingSubs.values()]));\n      }\n    }\n    return {\n      type: AnimationMetadataType.State,\n      name: metadata.name,\n      style: styleAst,\n      options: astParams ?

This means\n * that when functional composition mix of these functions is evaluated (like in the example above)\n * then it will end up producing a tree of objects representing the animation itself.\n *\n * When this animation object tree is processed by the visitor code below it will visit each of the\n * verb statements within the visitor. And during each visit it will build the context of the\n * animation keyframes by interacting with the `TimelineBuilder`.\n *\n * [TimelineBuilder]\n * This class is responsible for tracking the styles and building a series of keyframe objects for a\n * timeline between a start and end time. The builder starts off with an initial timeline and each\n * time the AST comes across a `group()`, `keyframes()` or a combination of the two within a\n * `sequence()` then it will generate a sub timeline for each step as well as a new one after\n * they are complete.\n *\n * As the AST is traversed, the timing state on each of the timelines will be incremented. If a sub\n * timeline was created (based on one of the cases above) then the parent timeline will attempt to\n * merge the styles used within the sub timelines into itself (only with group() this will happen).\n * This happens with a merge operation (much like how the merge works in mergeSort) and it will only\n * copy the most recently used styles from the sub timelines into the parent timeline. This ensures\n * that if the styles are used later on in another phase of the animation then they will be the most\n * up-to-date values.\n *\n * [How Missing Styles Are Updated]\n * Each timeline has a `backFill` property which is responsible for filling in new styles into\n * already processed keyframes if a new style shows up later within the animation sequence.\n *\n * ```\n * sequence([\n *   style({ width: 0 }),\n *   animate(1000, style({ width: 100 })),\n *   animate(1000, style({ width: 200 })),\n *   animate(1000, style({ width: 300 }))\n *   animate(1000, style({ width: 400, height: 400 })) // notice how `height` doesn't exist anywhere\n * else\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * What is happening here is that the `height` value is added later in the sequence, but is missing\n * from all previous animation steps. Therefore when a keyframe is created it would also be missing\n * from all previous keyframes up until where it is first used. For the timeline keyframe generation\n * to properly fill in the style it will place the previous value (the value from the parent\n * timeline) or a default value of `*` into the backFill map.\n *\n * When a sub-timeline is created it will have its own backFill property. This is done so that\n * styles present within the sub-timeline do not accidentally seep into the previous/future timeline\n * keyframes\n *\n * [Validation]\n * The code in this file is not responsible for validation. That functionality happens with within\n * the `AnimationValidatorVisitor` code.\n */\nfunction buildAnimationTimelines(driver, rootElement, ast, enterClassName, leaveClassName, startingStyles = new Map(), finalStyles = new Map(), options, subInstructions, errors = []) {\n  return new AnimationTimelineBuilderVisitor().buildKeyframes(driver, rootElement, ast, enterClassName, leaveClassName, startingStyles, finalStyles, options, subInstructions, errors);\n}\nclass AnimationTimelineBuilderVisitor {\n  buildKeyframes(driver, rootElement, ast, enterClassName, leaveClassName, startingStyles, finalStyles, options, subInstructions, errors = []) {\n    subInstructions = subInstructions || new ElementInstructionMap();\n    const context = new AnimationTimelineContext(driver, rootElement, subInstructions, enterClassName, leaveClassName, errors, []);\n    context.options = options;\n    const delay = options.delay ?

The regular mode uses the\n// recommended a11y pattern which has `role=\"group\"` on the group element with `aria-labelledby`\n// pointing to the label. This works for `mat-select`, but it seems to hit a bug for autocomplete\n// under VoiceOver where the group doesn't get read out at all. The bug appears to be that if\n// there's __any__ a11y-related attribute on the group (e.g. `role` or `aria-labelledby`),\n// VoiceOver on Safari won't read it out.\n// We've introduced the `inert` mode as a workaround. Under this mode, all a11y attributes are\n// removed from the group, and we get the screen reader to read out the group label by mirroring it\n// inside an invisible element in the option. This is sub-optimal, because the screen reader will\n// repeat the group label on each navigation, whereas the default pattern only reads the group when\n// the user enters a new group.
